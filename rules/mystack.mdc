# Technical Stack
- Backend languages preferred that are easiest to deploy. usually javascript/node, but open to other options if you can provide reasons to try them. 
- html/js for frontend. 
- tailwind for UI and components
- sqlite for databases unless you first ask me if I want something else
- write tests
